# Hello there! 👋 I'm ArkussD

I'm an aspiring Systems Developer and Game Dev, deeply interested in system memory, low-level performance, and the long-term goal of building my own engine.

I'm currently focusing on Rust and the Bevy game engine to master the language's performance benefits and its approach to Entity Component Systems (ECS) before diving into custom architecture.

## ⚙️ Core Focus

Language: Rust

Engine Learning: Bevy

Goal: Building memory-aware systems and developing custom low-level engine architecture.

## 🚀 Projects

I enjoy shipping small, complete ideas. Check out some of my work below:

[Bevy Prototype Name]: A small game concept testing Bevy's ECS architecture and performance limits.

[Rust Tool Name]: A command-line utility for system-level or game development workflow.

## 💡 Fun Fact

I believe the future of game dev is open source, memory-safe, and deeply efficient at the system level.
